# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:

In the new analysis I created a new summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, I used Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multi-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results:

   # Total Rides
  * ![Fig2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84756166/126078336-d33f140b-68e2-491f-ab49-1cd337a6cbb4.png)

### Note:
According to the total rides count, different city types receive different proportions of acitivity. Urban cities are the most active with 1625 rides. 
  
  # Total Drivers

### Note:
According to total drivers, each city type varies. In Rural areas the number of rides is greater than the number of drivers. However, in Urban areas the total number of drivers far outweighs the number of available rides. In the suburbs there is more of a balance with 490 total drivers and 625 total rides. 
  # Total Fares

According to total fares, most of Pyber's profits are made in Urban areas. 
  # Average Fare per Ride/Average Fare per Driver

  When we look at Average Fare per Ride, Rural areas have high fares per ride and Urban areas have the lowest fare cost per ride. Again suburbs fall in the middle. 
  When we look at Average Fare per Driver, Rural areas have the highest cost of fares per driver and Urban areas have the lowest cost of fares per driver. Suburbs     fall in the middle. 
  
  We can infer that saturation of the market drives down the avg prices. More rides equals more drivers and lower total fares.

  Figures above show that the three city types act as 3 seperate markets. However, our multi-line graph shows that the markets are actually linked in their behavior   week-by-week. The three line plots rise and fall in unison and show that these 3 markets act together. 
  

## Summary:

  Overall, my recommendation is to unite these three markets into one large market. There are three steps that should be taken to do this.  
  
  1. Encourage inter-city-type travel. This help boost total rides in more remote communities. We know that increase in demand leads to increase in drivers and an overall decrease in pricing as exemplified in the Urban cities. 
  
  2. Take the burden off all drivers.  Encourage more drivers to move from Urban areas to rural areas to transport people to and from the urban and suburban communites. Doing so will help relieve the rural and suburban driver deficit as well as give more work to the drivers in urban areas. 
  
  3. Emphasize lower prices. If we increase our volume across all three city types I predict a leveling of inflated ride fares in rural and suburban areas.
